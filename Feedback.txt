- Why are we doing this?
The key point of this project is to improve our skills and apply all knowledge we got from the previous 4 weeks of learning.  


- How I expected the challenge to go.
I expected it to be very complex and complicated, but at the beginning, I tried to simplify all tasks I have and started work from tasks I was familiar with.


- What went well?
I split tasks into smaller tasks and started by making scripts and Dockerfiles with Jenkinfile, when everything runs without errors, I went to the next stage 
and create docker-compose with playbook, and nexus. The last step was to test everything with SonarQube and see the quality of code and security issues, itâ€™s 
also been fully implemented.


- What didn't go as planned?
The real issue was to install everything to VM every Monday, especially when VM stop responds because of a lost connection. Some days connection has been lost 
for a few hours, no matter how many times I try to reset/reboot/restart/turn off/turn on and so on. 


- Possible improvements for future challenges.
Do not be overstressed when in the middle of the working process VM losing connection, and by resetting VM, all files which haven't been added to Git are lost.
